    <H1>Q10 - Hover Paragraph Example</H1>

    <p>Anime is a style of animated storytelling that originated in Japan and has grown into a global cultural phenomenon. 
    Unlike many Western cartoons that are often aimed primarily at children, anime covers a wide range of genres and age groups, 
    from action-packed adventures and fantasy epics to romance, science fiction, horror, and slice-of-life stories.
    Its distinct visual style, featuring expressive characters, detailed backgrounds, and dynamic action sequences, 
    helps to bring an imaginative world to life. Over the decades, anime has evolved both artistically and technically, 
    blending traditional hand-drawn techniques with modern digital animation.</p>

    <p>The international popularity of anime has been fuelled by iconic films and series such as Spirited Away and 
    long-running shows like Naruto. Streaming platforms and fan communities have made it easier than ever for audiences 
    around the world to access and discuss new releases. Beyond entertainment, anime often explores meaningful themes such 
    as friendship, identity, resilience, and morality, allowing viewers to connect deeply with the characters and stories.
    As a result, anime is not just a form of animation; it is a powerful storytelling medium that continues to influence global pop culture.</p>
